The Odin Project #6 - Tic Tac Toe

3/6/2021 - In this project, I am being introduced to some new concepts... mainly using modular programming in Javascript, and function factories as opposed to classes/constructors. So far, board is up and running and players can take turns placing an X and a O. However, it still doesn't alternate turns properly after a few tries so this needs to be fixed.

3/8/2021 - First version complete. Basic gameloop works and everything is ticked off in terms of functionality and basic layout/design. Winning message appears at top, or a tie message depending on the result with an option to click a link to play again. Next I will do some refactoring and cleaning up.
